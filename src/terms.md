# Terms and Conditions

Last Updated: December 27, 2024

## Introduction
These Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") govern your use of Entropy Systems, Inc.'s ("Provider", "we", "us", or "our") Asteroid supervision and evaluation platform for LLM-based systems ("Product"). Our platform allows users to monitor, supervise and evaluate AI agents. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms.

## 1. Service Access and Use

### 1.1 Access and Use of Asteroid Platform
During the Subscription Period and subject to these terms, Customer may (a) access and use the Asteroid platform for LLM supervision and evaluation; and (b) copy and use the included Software and Documentation only as needed to access and use the Asteroid platform, in each case, for its internal business purposes. If a Customer Affiliate enters a separate Order Form with Provider, the Customer's Affiliate creates a separate agreement between Provider and that Affiliate, where Provider's responsibility to the Affiliate is individual and separate from Customer and Customer is not responsible for its Affiliates' agreement.

### 1.2 Support
During the Subscription Period, Provider will provide Technical Support as described in the subscription plan.

### 1.3 User Accounts
Customer is responsible for all actions on Users' accounts and for all Users' compliance with this Agreement. Customer and Users must protect the confidentiality of their passwords and login credentials. Customer will promptly notify Provider if it suspects or knows of any fraudulent activity with its accounts, passwords, or credentials, or if they become compromised.

### 1.4 Feedback and Usage Data
Customer may, but is not required to, give Provider Feedback, in which case Customer gives Feedback "AS IS". Provider may use all Feedback freely without any restriction or obligation. Provider may collect and analyze Usage Data, and Provider may freely use Usage Data to maintain, improve, enhance, and promote Provider's products and services without restriction or obligation. However, Provider may only disclose Usage Data to others if the Usage Data is aggregated and does not identify Customer or Users.

### 1.5 Customer Content
Provider may copy, display, modify, and use Customer Content only as needed to provide and maintain the Product and related offerings. Customer is responsible for the accuracy and content of Customer Content.

### 1.6 Machine Learning
Usage Data and Customer Content may be used to develop, train, or enhance artificial intelligence or machine learning models that are part of Provider's products and services, including third-party components of the Product, and Customer authorizes Provider to process its Usage Data and Customer Content for such purposes. However, (a) Usage Data and Customer Content must be aggregated before it can be used for these purposes, and (b) Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with industry standard technology to de-identify Usage Data and Customer Content before such use. Nothing in this section will reduce or limit Provider's obligations regarding Personal Data that may be contained in Usage Data or Customer Content under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Due to the nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning, information generated by these features may be incorrect or inaccurate. Product features that include artificial intelligence or machine learning models are not human and are not a substitute for human oversight.

## 2. Restrictions and Obligations

### 2.1 Restrictions on Customer
Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, Customer will not (and will not allow anyone else to):
1. Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Product (except to the extent Applicable Laws prohibit this restriction)
2. Provide, sell, transfer, sublicense, lend, distribute, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or use the Product
3. Remove any proprietary notices or labels
4. Copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Product
5. Conduct security or vulnerability tests on, interfere with the operation of, cause performance degradation of, or circumvent access restrictions of the Product

8. Use the Product with any High Risk Activities or with any activity prohibited by Applicable Laws

Use of the Product must comply with all Documentation and Use Limitations.

### 2.2 Suspension
If Customer (a) has an outstanding, undisputed balance on its account for more than 30 days; (b) breaches Section 2.1 (Restrictions on Customer); or (c) uses the Product in violation of the Agreement or in a way that materially and negatively impacts the Product or others, then Provider may temporarily suspend Customer's access to the Product with or without notice. However, Provider will try to inform Customer before suspending Customer's account when practical. Provider will reinstate Customer's access to the Product only if Customer resolves the underlying issue.

The Product is offered through different pricing plans, which are available at our pricing page (https://asteroid.ai/pricing).

Customer will pay Provider Fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars according to the Payment Process.

### 4.6 Payment Dispute
If Customer has a good-faith disagreement about the Fees charged or invoiced, Customer must notify Provider about the dispute before payment is due, or within 30 days of an automatic payment, and must pay all undisputed amounts on time. The parties will work together to resolve the dispute within 15 days.
